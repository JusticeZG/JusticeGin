                <h2>
                    This school project required me to design a sports brand and imprint the branding on various merchandise and clothing.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    For my sports brand, I chose the extreme sport BMX dirt bike racing. Due to it being such an aggreessive sport, I took inspiration from esport brand logos. This is because they have use a lot of diagonal lines, pointed edges, and high contrasting colours.
                    This made the sketching process easier and quicker since I had a direction that I wanted to follow.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Once I finalized the logo, making the concept jersey, pants, and shirt was easy. I only had to do small warping jobs and lighting altering on Photoshop.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    If there was one thing I would change, it would be to make the concept art a little more realistic, and to change the font of the spread since the readability could be improved.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Thanks to this project, I now understand how to go through a design process that caters towards a certain audience. I have experience with creating a brand and applying the brand to products.
