                This piece belongs to a set of two. The two pieces have intertwining meanings that emphasize eachother. Unfortunately, I can't display the other half of the set on this website at the moment. Due to complications of the pandemic, I don't have access to
                the other piece.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                As this was a school project, I was required to have printed images on the canvas. I wanted to have the impression of the photos imitating memories so I opted to have pictures of family. I used photoshop to adjust the hue and saturations of various photos
                and then stuck them onto the canvas. I then painted the background colours that would blend with the photos.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                I wanted the piece to make an impact of emotions not just through the shapes and forms, but also through the colours and gestures made by my brush.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                The colours chosen were meant to make you feel somber, but with hints of happiness at the same time. That is why I chose dark blues and purples. The small strokes of pink across the canvas offsets the gloominess and adds the "happiness".
            </h2>
            <h2>
                The subjects portrayed in the painting is my brother, and my cousin. I felt that they looked awkward floating in the middle of the canvas so in the highlights and shadows, I added pinks and blues. This brought the piece together in the end.
