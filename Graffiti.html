            <h2>
                This school project was assigned to my class after we visited Graffiti Alley. I wanted to make something unique to graffiti so I strayed away from creating something asymmetrical. This also complemented the word I chose, which was 0w0.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                During the planning phase, I wanted to give the design a personality, so I made a few drafts of faces utilizing the word. However, I wasn't satisfied with the designs I made. So I decided to base the face off of a bug.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Once I started to digitalize my design, the project started to look a lot better. The texture on the design provides depth and further enlargens the eyeballs.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                By itself, I thought that the design looked rather empty for graffiti. So I added streaks surrounding the word, however it strained your eyes against the white blank background. To solve this, I added a red circle so that it contrasted greatly with both
                the streaks and the main word.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                My teacher had us put the final product, the sketch-ups, and a process paragraph onto one spread. The background rounded out the final product nicely on the spread, and helped to space things out.
